## Reporting a Vulnerability

We prioritize the safety of the student community. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1.  **Do not** create a public GitHub issue.
2.  Please report vulnerabilities via the "Private vulnerability reporting" feature on this repository (if enabled) or contact the project maintainer directly.
3.  We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours and will provide a patch.

Thank you for helping keep CampusTrade secure!
